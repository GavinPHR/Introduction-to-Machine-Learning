# Game Theory

My revision notes for the course Algorithmic Game Theory and its Applications (INFR11020), taught by Professor Kousha Etessami. 

We covered the basics of game theory including:
- Games in strategic and extensive forms
- Games with complete/incompelte/perfect/imperfect information
- Game on graphs
- Zero sum games
- Linear programming and the simplex algorithm
- Markov decision process and stochastic games
- Second price auctions

This is one of the most interesting courses in my undergraduate degree with broad applications. Though most of the topics taught assume agents are self-interested and rational, far from what the real world is like.
