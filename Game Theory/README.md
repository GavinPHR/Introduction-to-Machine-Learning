# Game Theory

My revision notes for the course Algorithmic Game Theory and its Applications (INFR11020), taught by Professor Kousha Etessami. 

We covered the basics of game theory including:
- Games in strategic and extensive forms
- Games with complete/incompelte/perfect/imperfect information
- Zero sum games
- Linear programming and the simplex algorithm
- Congestion games
- Bayesian games, Vickrey and VCG auctions

This is one of the most interesting courses in my undergraduate degree with broad applications. Though most of the topics taught assume agents are self-interested and rational, far from what the real world is like.
